# Jun Li's Website
## Introduction
This project is the website to show the audience my performance of car design. I can design exterior looking of the future car and even some parts of the interior, so I would like to look for some clients and employer to realize my value!
## Photographic
My photos are all export from Photoshop. Also, the logo represents my design idea, which catches the audience's eyes like a panda.
## To contact me
I decide to have two contact ways for my audience which list my all information and send me the inquiry then contact with him/her later. This website looks likely to raise my chance to win my audience.
## How it works
I had used Google Chrome and Firefox to load my website, and both work well. Also, I had uploaded my file to Github step by step.
